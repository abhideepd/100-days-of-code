# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: April 1, 2024

**Today's Progress**: Committed on twitter, about starting this challenge. Forgot to use the hashtag 'learninpublic', then got to know, edit is a premium feature :-( 

**Thoughts:** Well, this will help me stay accountable. I had done this challenge previously. Although, its was a bit tough, still managed to stay alive until the 35th day, then had to end it due to a health sanfu.
